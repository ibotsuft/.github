# iBots 2D UFT

The iBots team was established in 2010 by Professor Alexandre Rossini and students Tanilson Dias, Horiano Gomes, Edcarllos Gonçalves, Guilherme Batista, and Vitor Sousa, all hailing from the Computer Science program at the Federal University of Tocantins. In that inaugural year, they took part in the Latin American Robotics Competition, where they secured the 8th position among 9 competing teams. This first iteration of iBots was based on the UvA Trilearn platform, which turned out to be their final reliance on this particular foundation. Following the competition, they transitioned to using HELIOS-BASE, also known as agent2d.

Over the years, the team actively participated in various events, including the 2011 "Competição Brasileira de Robótica" (CBR), the Brazilian Robotics Competition, as well as the 2012 LARC, 2013 CBR, 2015 CBR, and their final event in 2016, the CBR.

Subsequently, the team went on a hiatus until 2023 when it was resurrected as a subject of research for undergraduate student Eric Jonai. Professor Tanilson Dias, one of the original founders of iBots, served as his advisor during this period. Later in the same year, the team also became a focal point of research for the "Programa Institucional de Bolsas de Iniciação Científica" (PIBIC), undertaken by student Érick Santos.

Today, iBots has set its sights on several goals, including the refactoring of legacy iBots code from previous versions, fostering the enthusiasm of new students to delve into this field, a dedicated focus on Coach Agents, and active participation in upcoming robotics competitions.

## Our work

Throughout their participation in six events, the iBots team was required to submit a Team Description Paper (TDP) for each of them, resulting in a total of six papers authored by the iBots. Furthermore, a number of participants also chose iBots as the subject of their research endeavors.
